## API Integration

The application integrates with the [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) API, which provides a realistic simulation of a user management backend. The following endpoints are used:

| Endpoint            | Method | Description                  |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `/api/login`        | POST   | User authentication          |
| `/api/users?page=N` | GET    | Retrieve paginated user list |
| `/api/users/{id}`   | GET    | Get single user details      |
| `/api/users/{id}`   | PUT    | Update user information      |
| `/api/users/{id}`   | DELETE | Remove a user                |
